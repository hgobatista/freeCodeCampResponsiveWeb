------ Wrap radio buttons in a <fieldset>
       element for better accessibility
       
The next form topic covers the accessibility of
radio buttons. Each choice is given a |label|
with a |for| attribute tying to the |id| of the
corresponding item as covered in the last
challenge. Since radio buttons often come in a
group where the user must choose one, there's
a way to semantically show the choices are part
of a set.

The |fieldset| tag surrounds the entire
grouping of radio buttons to achieve this. It
often uses a |legend| tag to provide a
description for the grouping, which screen
readers read for each choice in the |fieldset|
element.

The |fieldset| wrapper and |legend| tag are
not necessary when the choices are self-
explanatory, like a gender selection. Using a
|label| with the |for| attribute for each radio
button is sufficient.

Here's an example:
-----------------------
<form>
  <fieldset>
    <legend>Choose one of these three items></legend>
    <input id="one" type="radio" name="items" value="one">
    <label for="one">Choice One</label><br>
    <input id="two" type="radio" name="items" value="two">
    <label for="two">Choice two</label><br>
    <input id="three" type="radio" name="items" value="three>
    <label for="three">Choice three</label>
  </fieldset>
</form>

------ Add an accessible date picker

Forms often include the |input| field, which can
be used to create several different form
controls. Tje |type| attribute on this element
indicates what king of |input| element will be
created.

You may have noticed the |text| and |submit|
input types in prior challenges, and HTML5
introduced an option to specify a |date| field.
Depending on browser support, a date picker
shows up in the |input| field when it's in focus,
which makes filling in a form easier for all users.

For older browsers, the type will default to
|text|, so it helps to show users the expected
date format in the |label| or |placeholder| text
just in case.

Here's an example:
-----------------------
<label for="input1">Enter a date></label>
<input type="date" id="input1" name="input1">
-----------------------

------ Standardize times with the HTML5 
       attribute datetime <time datetime="">

Continuing with the date theme, HTML5 also
introduced the |time| element along with a
|datetime| attribute to standardize times. The
|time| element is an inline element that can wrap a
date or time on a page. A |datetime| attribute holds
a valid format of that date. This is the value
accessed by assistive devices. It helps avoid
confusion by stating a stardardzed version of a
time, even if it's informally or colloquialli written in
the text.

Here's an example:
-----------------------
<p>Master Camper Cat officiated the cage match between Goro
and Scorpion <time datetime="2013-02-13'>last wednesday</time>,
wich ended in a draw.
</p>
