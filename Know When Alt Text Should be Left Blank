Sometimes images are grouped with a
caption already describing them, or are
used for decoration only. In these cases,
|alt| text may seem redundant or
unnecessary.

When an image is already explained with
text content or does not add meaning to
a page, the |img| still needs an |alt|
attribute, but it can be set to an empty
string. Here's an example:

<img src="visualDecoration.jpeg" alt="">

Background images usually fall under the
'decorative' label as well. However, they
are typically applied with CSS rules, and
therefore not part of the markup screen
readers process.

Note: For images with a caption, you may
still want to include |alt| text since it
helps search engines catalog the image's
content.
